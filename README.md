# Prettier-UniBa-VC
Stylus Style sheet for a better (opinionated) Uni Bamberg VC appearance

## How to use
Install the Stylus extension https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/. Add a new style for URL `vc.uni-bamberg.de`. Paste text from desired style file into the style code.

### stylus_vc_compact_1 
- removes the text-truncation that makes a lot of course titles impossible to read
- more compact favorites in the dashboard
- size-limited main content box, because default is very wide on big monitors
- reset font size in course view to 1rem. This makes it easier to read on WQHD monitors and also fixes the weird font display when zooming/enlarging the page.

Tested on Firefox.
